Hugging Face provides a large ecosystem of open source tools for working with generative AI. To get started using it, you need to be able to navigate it all.In this code-along, you'll learn how to find and use suitable models for your analysis and AI projects, and work with both text and image data. You'll explore a case study of using AI to improve captions for fashion product images.
